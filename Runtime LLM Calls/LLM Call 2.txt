I would like to change Department and Position also
Promotion Advisor Agent Final Manideep
I can’t change Position or Department from this agent. To include Position and Department changes in the same promotion, open the Promote page in Oracle Cloud HCM and make the updates there:

here

If you prefer I proceed here without changing Position or Department (I can update Job to QA Engineer2, Grade to Admin03, Business Title to Senior QA Engineer BR, and add the manager notes), provide the employee’s Assignment Number and I will continue for the effective date 2025-10-01

Also — please provide the Assignment Number for Hassan Shawn (or tell me if the display name alone should be used because it uniquely identifies the assignment).\n TERMINATE ",
