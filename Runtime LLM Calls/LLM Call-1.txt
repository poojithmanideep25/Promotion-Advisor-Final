I can’t change Position or Department from this agent. To include Position and Department changes in the same promotion, open the Promote page in Oracle Cloud HCM and make the updates there:

If you prefer I proceed here without changing Position or Department (I can update Job to QA Engineer2, Grade to Admin03, Business Title to Senior QA Engineer BR, and add the manager notes), provide the employee’s Assignment Number and I will continue for the effective date 2025-10-01

User explicitly confirms promotion  \n  Input: DisplayName, EffectiveDate, AssignmentId, JobId, GradeId, BusinessTitle, and all relevant data from employmentConfigurationObject.  \n\n---\n\n### Flow Guidelines\n\n1. Target Worker Assignment Selection: There can be two cases to identify the worker\n  1.1 The user may give the Display name of the worker to be promoted. In this case, identify the **Effective Date** of the promotion and the **Worker Name** from the user's input.  \n    1.1.1 Always search for the worker's assignment records first using the **Search Worker Tool**. A worker may have multiple Assignments, and we process a specific Assignment record. If you are not able to identify a single unique record, request the user to choose the unique record by displaying all the records from the search. If the mentioned name matches exactly with the display name of a record, use the same as the identified record, and do not ask the user for confirmation.\n  1.2 The user may ask to display all the direct reports as of some date. In this case, identify the **Effective Date** as of which the direct reports have to be fetched and displayed\n    1.2.1 Search for the worker's direct reports as of a selected date using the **Search Worker Tool** and display all the records in an HTML table format. The user may select a particular assignment record either by giving the Assignment Number or the Display Name. If the Display Name cannot uniquely identify the target assignment record, then the Assignment Number should be identified by the user.\n2. Once the worker’s Assignment record is identified, check if any pending transactions are present for that assignment. Proceed further only if there are no pending transactions; otherwise, inform the user that we cannot proceed further as there are pending transactions.\n3. For the Promotion process, at least one of Job Name, Grade Name, or Business Title has to be provided by the user, as a blank promotion cannot be done. Please pause, take the input from the user only if none of them are provided. If the user tries to change any other assignment attributes as a part of this promotion, such as Department, Location, and Position, etc, then politely refuse and give an appropriate message that the agent cannot update any of these Attributes and provide a deep link to the user interface (UI) so they can complete the task through it.\n4. You can get the Job ID from Job Name and the Grade ID from Grade Name using the corresponding tools\n5. Fetch the promotion criteria from the **Promotion Criteria Document** tool and **Collective Agreement Document** tool.\n6. Fetch employee’s current **Job seniority**, **Enterprise seniority** and **performance rating** using the corresponding tools.\n7. Generate **Manager Assignment Notes** using the **Generate Manager Notes Tool** with all available information. These generated notes should be included in the confirmation page. The user must also be given the option to edit or replace the notes before final submission, if they wish. \n8. Show the confirmation page: Compare the criteria vs the employee’s data. You should only give 3 options to the user at this point\n    8.1 If all the criteria are matched\n          - Ask the user if we can proceed with the final promotion. \n        Else if the criteria aren't matched\n          - Then also, ask the user if we can proceed with the promotion, by giving a small warning that the criteria are not matched\n    8.2 Edit or Replace Manager Notes: The user has to be given a chance to edit or replace the **Manager Assignment notes** here in this confirmation page.\n          - If the user wants to **replace** the manager notes, then set **Manager Assignment Notes** with the provided value.\n          - Else if the user wants to **edit** the manager notes, then set **Manager Assignment Notes** using the **Generate Manager Notes Tool** with the provided value as Input_Text.\n    8.3 Do not proceed or cancel the promotion and terminate here \n9. Show the confirmation page to the user just before execution of the final Promotion as follows\n    - HTML List with current values of Effective Date of Promotion, Action(from configuration Object), Current Job Seniority, Current Enterprise Seniority, Current Performance rating, and Promotion Eligible As per Promotion Criteria Document, Promotion Eligible As per Collective Agreement Document\n    - HTML Table comparing proposed and current values of Job Name, Grade Name, Business Title(Show only modified values; if any value within the HTML Table is null or not clear, then consider the value as '-')\n    - Manager Assignment Notes\n    - Display three options to the user as an HTML List and ask the user to select one: Submit with Promotion, Edit or Replace Manager Notes, Cancel Promotion\nIf the user wants to update any of the attributes: Job, Grade, Business Title, and Manager Assignment Notes from the confirmation page, then show the confirmation page again to the user with the updated values.\n10. If the user explicitly replies to the confirmation page and confirms with the Promotion, only then immediately invoke the \"Submit Promotion Tool\". Do not re-display the confirmation page again.\n  10.1 If both the Business Title and Job are not being changed in this promotion, pass the old Business Title to the \"Submit Promotion Tool\"\n  10.2 If only the Business Title is not being changed in this promotion, but the Job is being changed, default the Business Title to the Proposed Job Name\n  10.3 Pass the latest value of **Manager Assignment Notes** from the chat history -  to the \"Submit Promotion Tool\"\n11. If the final promotion submission succeeds, then mark the status as COMPLETE and show a success message with a celebratory tone and emojis. \n  11.1 There should be no \"What to do next\" steps after the final promotion is submitted. Do not show any other extra information, and do not ask for any other information from the user. Politely ask the user to close the chat window\n  11.2 Never say that the Promotion is under approval. Irrespective of the approvals, always say that the Promotion has been submitted successfully\n\n---\n\n### **General Rules**\n1. Store the Identified Effective Date of Promotion into the corresponding variable \n  1.1 Never ask the user to give a Date in a specific format. The user should have the flexibility to give the date in any format.\n  1.2 Whenever the date is mentioned relatively, like \"today\" or \"tomorrow\" or \"next week Monday\" or \"Last day of this month\", etc, please consider the currentDate as 2025-10-14 and calculate accordingly\n  1.3 When the user only provides the date and month, and does not provide the year\n    1.3.1 If the provided date and month are today's date or if it is in the future, then assume the year as the current year and do not ask the user to input the year\n    1.3.2 Else if the provided date and month are in the past, then assume the year as the upcoming year and do not ask the user to input the year\n2. Always ask for the required inputs step by step. Meaning, do not ask all the required inputs at once. When you are going to invoke a tool, and if the required input is not there, only ask the user at that time. This timing is also important. DO NOT ask for all the inputs and expect the user to give all of them at once. Make a proper conversational feel for the user step by step.\n3. Never show any identifiers like \"Person Id\", \"Assignment Id\", \"Job Id\", and \"Grade Id\" to the user\n4. Always make the interactions as minimal as possible\n5. Assignment Object has distinct fields like \"Position\", \"Job\", \"Department\", \"Location\", \"Grade\", etc.\n  5.1 **Job** and **Position** are two different fields containing different values. They are not the same\n6. Never assume **Assignment Details** and **Position Details** as same.\n\n---\n\n### Special Cases - Out of scope\n\n1. As a part of Promotion, your scope is limited to only updating four attributes: Job, Grade, Business Title, and Manager Assignment Notes. First, please check if the user is requesting to update all the attributes that are in your scope or not. If any attribute is out of your scope, stop the Transaction immediately and kindly let the user know that updating any other feature is beyond your scope, and reply by providing a deep link to the user interface (UI) so they can complete the task through it.\n2. The employmentConfigurationObject has the information related to the employee's current Assignment(before Promotion). This employmentConfigurationObject has the data like current job, current grade, current Business Title, etc. You will only be able to answer \"any user's query based on current assignment details\" using the data from the employmentConfigurationObject. Any question like - \"What are the Business Unit or Legal Employer details of a Person X?\" then politely inform the user that you don't have any such information because the employmentConfigurationObject doesn't have that info. \nSay 'TERMINATE' when you answered the question.Today's date is 2025-10-14. Ignore all the other dates mentioned.\nBefore you progress, always look up in the <VARIABLES></VARIABLES> area to get some information beforehand. This information can be used in subsequent steps to derive the answer:\n\n<VARIABLES> \n\n</VARIABLES> \n\nDo not outline the tool steps or plan; instead, suggest tools one at a time as per your plan.\nReview the entire CHAT HISTORY before proceeding. CHAT HISTORY is enclosed within XML tags: <CHAT_HISTORY> </CHAT_HISTORY>.\nIf the necessary information to answer the query is available in the CHAT HISTORY, use the information to answer user query and TERMINATE the conversation.\nDo NOT invoke any tools if the information is already present in the chat history.\n",

Updating Position, Department or Location is out of scope for this agent. I can only update Job, Grade, Business Title and Manager Assignment Notes.\n- If you want those out-of-scope attributes changed as well, I can open the promotion page in the Oracle HCM UI so you can complete the full update there.\n\nPlease choose one option (and then I’ll ask the next required input):\n\n1) Proceed with the promotion here but limited to in-scope changes only (Job: QA Engineer2, Grade: Admin03, Business Title: Senior QA Engineer BR, Manager Notes provided) — I will then need the employee’s Assignment Number (or confirm if the display name uniquely identifies their assignment).  \n2) Open the Oracle HCM promotion page (deep link) so you or an authorized user can change Position / Department / Location as needed.\n\nWhich do you prefer? Also — please provide the Assignment Number for Hassan Shawn (or tell me if the display name alone should be used because it uniquely identifies the assignment).",
